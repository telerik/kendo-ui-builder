# Globalization Overview

Globalization is a process which combines the translation of messages (localization) and the usage of specific culture locales (internationalization).

The messages in an application, generated by the Kendo UI Builder, consist of:

* Component strings&mdash;Represent the translatable content that appears within the components you have included in the project.

  Each Kendo UI component you add to your web project supports the globalization features that are delivered by the respective Kendo UI suite. For example, the Kendo UI for Angular Grid provides support for internationalization and localization according to the article on [globalization](http://k2build.openstack.progress.com/kendo-angular-ui-develop/components/grid/globalization/).   

* Application strings&mdash;Represent the translatable content that appears in the generated application apart from the component messages. The change of the culture locale and the implementation of the application translations is done manually. For more information, refer to the article on [message translations and culture modification]({% slug messages_kuib %}).

> The Builder does not provide right-to-left (RTL) support.

The Builder organizes its translatable messages format in the `key:value` pair format which it draws from the translation libraries it utilizes.  
* For the Angular context, the Builder bases its supported globalization approaches on the [angular-translate library](https://angular-translate.github.io/).
* For AngularJS context, the Builder bases its supported globalization approaches on the [ngx-translate library](http://www.ngx-translate.com/).
