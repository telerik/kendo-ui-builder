# Bundling and Packaging

The Builder provides options to generate the web application in the debug and release (production) modes.

The **Generate** button is available on both the **App Design** page and the toolbar of each view. When clicked, it generates the latest source code of the application and outputs the `build_output/debug` and `build_output/release` local folders. The debug version of the generated application contains development-friendly code in a non-minimized format.

When the Builder generates applications for the Angular framework, it uses Angular CLI. When the Builder generates applications for the AngularJS framework, it uses Webpack.
