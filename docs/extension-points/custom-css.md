# Custom Styles

The Builder enables you to customize the styles of the generated web project.

When you create a view, the Builder generates a custom `.css` file in which you can define specific styles for that view and edit them through the **Edit CSS** button. To use the view styles, define the CSS classes for the view by utilizing the `list` CSS class property.
