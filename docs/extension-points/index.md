# Extension Points Overview

The extension points represent different means by which you can further customize the appearance and behavior of the generated application. You will often need to handle events, extract common logic in monolitic structures, like your own components and view, tweak the layout and appearance, import 3rd party libraries and so on.

The available options for customizing the generated web application are:

* [Custom code]({% slug customcode_kuib %})
* [Custom templates]({% slug customtemplates_kuib %})
* [Custom styles]({% slug customstyles_kuib %})
* [Custom themes]({% slug customthemes_kuib %})
* [Extending package.json]({% slug extendingpackages_kuib %})
* [Extending the HTML head]({% slug extendinghead_kuib %})
