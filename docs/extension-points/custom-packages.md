# Extending package.json

The Builder enables you to extend the existing `package.json` file by adding your own packages.

To include custom packages:

1. Add the `package.json` file to the `artifacts` folder on the root application level.
1. Add the necessary `dependencies` and `devDependences` to `package.json`.

    ```json
    {
        "dependencies": {
           "md5": "^2.2.1"
        }
    }
    ```

1. Click **Generate**. As a result, the custom `package.json` file is merged with `app/package.json` and the defined dependencies are installed.
