# Dashboard

When you open the Builder, it loads the initial Dashboard page.

The Dashboard is the user interface that assists you when you create an application, edit existing one and handle its settings.

The Dashboard page maintains the **Cards** and **List** views from where you can access the projects in the Builder.

## Initial Load

When you load the Builder for the first time and you have no current projects yet, the Dashboard provides the **Create App** option for creating a new project and the **Import App** option for importing existing projects. For more information on creating and importing applications, and managing their modules and data providers, refer to the article on [designing the application]({% slug designingtheapp_kuib %}#toc-applications-settings).

## App State

When you are working on your projects for a long period of time it might happen some issues with your apps. You could upgrade the Builder, import an application created with an older or newer version of the Builder or delete your app from the file system. In such cases you will not be able to work with your application. Every application with an issue has an **App State Label** in order to show you what is the issue and what further actions are needed.

For more information, refer to the documentation on [handling the app state]({% slug app_state_kuib %}) and [migration]({% slug migration_kuib %}).

// screen of app state labels

## Log Messages

The **>_OUTPUT** bar displays the log messages which are intended to facilitate the debugging and troubleshooting processes. For more information, refer to the articles on [output modes and debugging options]({% slug debugging_kuib %}) and [troubleshooting]({% slug troubleshooting_kuib %}).
